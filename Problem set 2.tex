\section {Gross Domestic Product - GDP}

\textbf{Question 1:} Define the GDP verbally. What are the differences between the real and the nominal GDP?

\textbf{Answer:} 

Gross Domestic Product - GDP: measures the market value $P_{it}Y_{it}$ of the sum of all final goods and services produced within an economy in a given period of time $t$

Nominal GDP measures the value of the output of the economy at current prices

Real GDP measures the value of the output of the economy using constant prices (i.e the prices of the selected base year) \\

\textbf{Question 2:} Explain why the nominal GDP is not (always) a proper indicator to describe the aggregate economic development. 

\textbf{Answer:} 

The change in GDP over time could be both due to changes in price level and changes in quantity of products. If we want to know whether economic well--being has increased overtime, nominal GDP using current prices is not an appropriate measure of this issue. \\

\textbf{Question 3:} How is the growth rate of the GDP defined?

\textbf{Answer:}

Growth rate is the increase in the market value of goods and services produced by an economy over time (e.g. from year to year).

\section {Macroeconomic Accounting}

\textbf{Question 5:} The GDP can be defined from three different points of view. List the three things the GDP measures.

\textbf{Answer:}

\begin{itemize}
\item Output/Product approach
\item Total Expenditure approach
\item Total Income approach
\end{itemize}  

\textbf{Question 6:}: What is the difference between the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) and the Gross National Product (GNP)? What is the difference between the Net Exports (NX) and the Current Account (CA)? What’s going on if $NX>0$ and $CA=0$?

\textbf{Answer:} 

GNP = GDP + Factor Payments from Abroad - Factor Payments to Abroad
Current Account = NX + Net Factor Payments from Abroad (NFIA) + unilateral transfer
If $NX>0$ and $CA=0$, then NFIA must be smaller than 0. This means that we export more to abroad than import products from abroad, and at the same time, we receive more payments from abroad to buy our exported products. \\

\textbf{Question 7:} What happens to GDP when the owner of a small firm marries her secretary and stops paying for his work, which he continuous to perform?

\textbf{Answer:} 
Nothing changes in GDP because either he pays himself as his salary or the money is retained in his firm's profit. \\

\textbf{Question 8:} I bought my house for €80,000. I have just sold it for €110,000, and the estate agent received a 10\% commission from the buyer. What is the effect on GDP?

\textbf{Answer:} 

Increase in GDP $= (110,000-80,000) + 110,000*0.1 = 30,000 + 11,000 = 41,000$ \\

\textbf{Question 9:} Define the term value added.

\textbf{Answer:} 

Value added is the difference between the value of the final output sold and the cost of purchasing the raw materials and intermediate goods needed to produce the output. \\

\textbf{Question 10:} A farmer grows a kilo of wheat and sells it to a miller for € 1. The miller turns the wheat into flour and then sells the flour to a baker for €3. The baker uses it to make bread and sells the bread for € 6 to an engineer who eats the bread. What is the value added by each person? What is GDP?

\textbf{Answer:} 

Value added if the farmer = €1
Value added of the miller = €2
Value added of the baker = €3
GDP = €6  \\

\textbf{Question 11:} What are the components of aggregate demand?

\textbf{Answer:} 

$$AD = C + I + G + X$$ \\

\textbf{Question 12:} Place each of the following transactions in one of the four components of expenditure for the German economy: consumption, investment, government purchases, and net exports: (a) BMW sells a car to a German household; (b) BMW sells a car to a US resident; (c) BMW sells a car to the German government; (d) BMW produces a car to be sold next year.

\textbf{Answer:} 
\begin{itemize}
\item a. BMW sells a car to a German household: Consumption
\item b. BMW sells a car to a US resident: Net export
\item c. BMW sells a car to the German government: Government purchases
\item d. BMW produces a car to be sold next year: Investment   \\
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Question 13:} How would the following transactions affect UK net capital outflow?

\textbf{Answer:}

Net capital outflow =  $S^{N} - I$
Net capital outflow = Amount domestic residents are lending to foreigners - Amount foreigners are lending to domestic residents = Outflow - Inflow

\begin{itemize}

\item a. A British mobile telephone company establishes an office in the Czech Republic: Outflow increases, Net capital outflow increases
\item b. An US company’s pension fund buys shares in BP: Inflow increases, Net capital outflow decreases
\item c. Toyota expands its factory in Derby, England: Inflow increases, Net capital outflow decreases
\item d. A London-based investment trust sells its Volkswagen shares to a French investor: Inflow increases, Net capital outflow decreases. 
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Question 14:} Holding national saving constant: Does an increase in net capital outflow increase, decrease or have no effect in a country's accumulation of domestic capital (stock)?

\textbf{Answer:}  

Net capital outflow = $S^{N} - I$
$\rightarrow I =  S^{N}$ - Net capital outflow
If $S^{N} = const$, 
\begin{itemize}
\item Net capital outflow $\uparrow \rightarrow I \downarrow$
\item Net capital outflow $\downarrow \rightarrow I \uparrow$
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Question 15:} Consider the following identity: $S^{P} – I = NX – S^{G}$. Show that the identity holds, explain what the identity means.

\textbf{Answer:}  
We have Income = Expenditure
$$C + S^{P} + T = C + I + G + (X - M)$$
$$\rightarrow S^{P} - I = -(T - G) + (X - M)$$
$$\rightarrow S^{P} - I = NX - S^{G}$$

$\rightarrow$ Private net saving = Trade balance - Government saving

\section{Consumer Price Indices, Inflation and Deflation}

\textbf{Question 16:} What does the consumer price index measure? How is it defined, and what is the differences between the CPI and the GDP-Deflator?

\textbf{Answer:} 
Consumer Price Index (CPI) measures the current price of a base year basket of goods and services relative to the price of the same basket in the base year

$$CPI_{t} = \frac{\sum_{j}P_{jt}Y_{j0}}{\sum_{j}P_{j0}Y_{j0}}$$

Difference between CPI and GDP Deflator:
\begin{itemize}
\item Deflator measures value of all goods, CPI considers only the goods in the consumer basket.
\item Deflator measures only goods that are domestically produced, imported goods are not considered
\item The CPI uses fixed basket whereas the deflator allows the basket to vary.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Question 17:} Define the term inflation rate. What is the differences between inflation, deflation and disinflation?

\textbf{Answer:} 
Inflation occurs when there is a significant and sustained increase in price index ($\pi>>0$)

Deflation occurs when there is a sustained decrease in consumer prices ($\pi<0$)

Disinflation is the short term slow down in the rate of inflation

\textbf{Question 18:} If the CPI in 2009 is 107 and 108.4 in 2010. Calculate the rate of inflation in 2010.

\textbf{Answer:} 

$$ \pi_{2010} = \frac{(108.4 - 107)}{107} = 1.31\%$$

e. Suppose H is equally happy eating red or green apples. The true cost of living does not change for H because he switches between red and green apple when their prices change.

\textbf{Question 21:} What is the difference between the real and nominal interest rate according to the Fisher equations?

\textbf{Answer:} 
\begin{itemize}
\item Nominal interest rate is the interest rate that banks pay
\item Real interest rate is the increase in your purchasing power
\item Fisher equation: $i = r + \pi$
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Question 22:} Define the terms ex-ante and ex-post and give an example.

\textbf{Answer:} 

\begin{itemize}
\item Ex-ante is something happens before (EX: expected inflation)
\item Ex-post is something happens after (when something is realized) (EX: realized inflation)
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Question 23:} List different costs of inflation.

\textbf{Answer:} 
\begin{itemize}
\item Shoe leather cost
\item Menu cost
\item Inflation induced tax distortions
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Question 24:} Define the term real and nominal variable and give an example of each.

\textbf{Answer:} 


\textbf{Question 25:} Statement: Inflation is reallocation of debt. What is meant by this? Does it matter whether the inflation is expected or unexpected? Explain!

\textbf{Answer:} 

Example: debtor and creditor enter into a long-term loan agreement. They both expect that inflation is low in the future, so they agree to set a low interest rate on this loan. Suppose that inflation is unexpectedly increasing over the next years, (1) the creditor receives a low interest payment because he already signed the contract and cannot increase the interest rate; (2) the real purchasing power of money is decreasing, which makes it even worse for creditor. In this case, creditor will lose, and debtor will gain. We can imagine a reverse situation if inflation decreases in the future. Therefore, unexpected inflation is a problem because it reallocates the wealth of debtor and creditor. \\

\section{Money and Monetary Aggregates}

\textbf{Question 26:} What is the difference between fiat and commodity money?

\textbf{Answer:} 

A fiat money is a legal claim as it attains all its properties from the law. 

Commodity money, on the other hand, is money that derives its value from a commodity of which it is made. \\

\textbf{Question 27:} Describe the functions of money in an economy. Which of these functions do the following items (not) satisfy? (a) a credit card; (b) a painting; (c) a bus ticket.

\textbf{Answer:} 

Functions of money in the economy:
\begin{itemize}
\item a stock of assets that store values: credit card, bus ticket, painting
\item a unit of account
\item a medium of exchange: painting
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Question 28:} What are open-market operations, and how do they influence the money supply?

\textbf{Answer:} 

OMOs are the purchase and sale of non-monetary assets (mainly government bonds)from and to the commercial banks by the central bank to expand or contract the money in the banking system.

To expand the money supply: central bank buys assets and pay them with ``newly'' printed money.

To reduce the money supply: central bank sells assets and receive money (and ``destroy'' it). \\

\textbf{Question 29:} What is the money market? What is the refinancing rate and how is it related to the money market?

\textbf{Answer:} 

Money market is where financial instruments with high liquidity and very short maturities are traded.

Refinancing rate is the rate at which commercial banks borrow from the central bank. Normally, these borrowings are extremely short term (overnight), therefore, the transactions happen in the money market.

\textbf{Question 30:} Write down the quantity equation of money and explain it.

\textbf{Answer:} 

Quantity equation of money: $M x v = P x Y$

This equation describe how the amount of money M in an economy is related to the number of economic transactions (= the economy's nominal output $PY$). $v$ is the velocity of money (number of times an euro bill changes hands in a given time period). \\

\textbf{Question 31:} Explain how (private) banks create money.

\textbf{Answer:} 

In a fractional reserve system, banks create money. Because commercial banks only keep a fraction of their deposits in reserve, and lend out the rest. The next bank receiving this amount of money will continue to keep only a fraction of deposits in reserve and lend out the rest. This process continues, and the total money supply created depends on the reserve ratio: Total money supply = $\frac{1}{rr}$ x Original Deposits. \\

\textbf{Question 32:} What are the various ways in which the central bank can influence the money sup-ply?

\textbf{Answer:} 

\textbf{Question 33:} Explain how each of the following events changes the money supply (if at all).

\textbf{Answer:} 

\begin{itemize}
\item a. The central bank buys bonds in an open market operation:
\item b. The central bank increases the interest rate it pays banks holding reserves:
\item c. Rumours about a computer virus attack on ATMs increase the amount of money people hold as currency rather than demand deposits:
\item d. The ECB flies a helicopter over the Frankfurt pedestrian precinct and drops 100 euro bills:
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Question 34:} Why might a banking crisis lead to a fall in money supply?
